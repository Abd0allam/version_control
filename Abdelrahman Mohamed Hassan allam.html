what is the difference between collaborators and contributors?

    A collaborator is someone who has been granted read/write access to a repository. Collaborators are typically people who have been invited to work on a project and have the ability to push changes directly to the repository without needing to fork the project. Collaborators can also be given administrative access to the repository, which allows them to manage issues, pull requests, and other repository settings.

    A contributor, on the other hand, is someone who submits changes to a project without being a collaborator. Contributors typically fork the repository, make changes in their own copy, and then submit a pull request to the original repository. The project maintainers can then review the changes and decide whether to merge them into the main codebase. Contributors do not have write access to the repository and cannot directly merge changes into the main codebase.

In short, collaborators have direct write access to a repository, while contributors must submit changes through a pull request and have their changes reviewed by the repository maintainers.
